# 👻 Project 3

In this repository are two submodules that link to my backend and frontend for Project 3. I worked by myself. 

## ⚙️ Backend

The backend is a Ruby on Rails REST API, interfaced with a PostgreSQL databse.

## 🖥 Frontend

The frontend is a React app, bootstrapped using `create-react-app`.
